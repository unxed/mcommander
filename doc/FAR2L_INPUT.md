# far2l keyboard extensions

M-Commander can take its keys from a terminal that speaks the far2l terminal
extensions (far2l's own terminal, and f4's). Such a terminal reports every key
with its virtual key code, character and Windows control key state, so the
combinations that collide in the legacy byte stream (Ctrl-Enter and Enter,
Shift-Tab, Ctrl-Shift-letter, Alt with a function key, and so on) are told apart.

## Negotiation

- At start M-Commander sends `ESC _ far2l1 ESC \` together with its other terminal
  questions, before Primary Device Attributes. A terminal with the extensions
  answers `ESC _ far2lok ESC \` (or ends it with BEL). Every other terminal
  ignores the APC and behaves as before.
- No question is asked when `TERM` is `screen*` or `tmux*`, or when `MC_FAR2L=0`
  is set.
- Whenever M-Commander gives the terminal to a subshell or a child program
  (Ctrl-O, running a command, an external editor or viewer) it sends
  `ESC _ far2l0 ESC \` first, and `ESC _ far2l1 ESC \` when it takes the terminal
  back and at start; the same goes for the exit. The child never gets a
  terminal that is still in far2l mode.
- With the extensions on, M-Commander does not turn on the kitty keyboard
  protocol or Win32 input mode: they would only carry the same information twice.
  A terminal without the extensions keeps using whichever of the two it knows.

## Keys

A key is `ESC _ f2l <base64> ESC \` (or BEL as the terminator). The payload is a
stack popped from the end, values little endian, the last byte the command:

| command | fields, in the order they are popped |
| --- | --- |
| `K` / `k` | character u32, control key state u32, scan code u16, virtual key u16, repeat count u16 |
| `C` / `c` | character u16, control key state u16, virtual key u8 |

Capital is a key press, small a release. A press is turned into a key by the same
rules as a Win32 input mode record (see the Win32 input mode change), and a release
is no key. Replies and resize packets are read and dropped.

## Mouse

far2l's terminal sends its mouse only as `M` packets (and the compact `m`) once the
extensions are on, never as xterm reports. M-Commander turns a packet into the SGR
report (`ESC [ < b ; x ; y M`) it asks for from other terminals and hands it back to
the keyboard, so the mouse code has one input: presses, releases, wheel turns and,
in button-event tracking, moves with a button held. Moves with nothing held and
horizontal wheel turns are not reported, and nothing is if the mouse is off.

A character outside ASCII in a key packet goes back to the keyboard as UTF-8 and is
read as a typed character.

## Plugin authors

Nothing changes for plugins: a key is the same integer code as before, whichever
way the terminal reported it, and a terminal without the extensions behaves exactly
as it did.

## Checking by hand

The tests in `tests/src/tty_far2l_input.c` replay packets through the real decoder.
By hand: in far2l's terminal or f4 run `mcommander`, press Ctrl-Enter, Shift-Tab and
Alt-F4 in the panels and see that each does its own action; run with
`MC_FAR2L=0` to compare with the legacy stream.

## Dropped files

A terminal that also has the far2l drag and drop protocol (far2l with it, f4; the
specification is docs/FAR2L_DND.md of https://github.com/unxed/f4) lets files be dragged
from the desktop onto the M-Commander window. Right after the extensions are switched on
M-Commander binds drop reception (BIND), and unbinds before the extensions go off, so a
child program never gets a drop. A terminal without the protocol answers nothing or an
empty reply, and nothing changes.

A drop is one small event naming an offer. M-Commander lists it (LIST), reads the files
one bounded chunk at a time (READ) and releases the offer (CLOSE): nothing travels unasked,
so the same works over SSH. The files go by M-Commander's own file access into the
directory of the panel under the drop, so a panel that shows an archive or a remote host
is no special case. If the terminal does not say where the drop landed, M-Commander asks
before it copies to the active panel. A drop is taken only while the panels are on top,
not in a dialog, the viewer or the editor. Existing files ask for overwrite, skip,
overwrite all or cancel, and a file that could not be received whole is removed.

Only plain files are taken, and only names that are plain names: a name with a slash, `..`
or a control character is refused. Every request is answered within 20 seconds or the drop
is given up.

While files are received a dialog shows the file, its place among the dropped ones and how much
of it is in, once the copy lasts longer than half a second. Esc or the Abort button there gives
the drop up: the file that was coming is removed, the ones that are already in stay, and the
offer is released as cancelled. A second drop waits for nothing: while one is being received,
another is turned down.

Not there yet: directories, a bigger window than one request at a time, and dropping into the
built-in terminal for the programs that run in it.
